# AbalonePCR
Linear regression performed after carrying out Principal Component Analysis to reduce high dimensionality on the Abalone Kaggle data set.
Root Square Mean Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) is used for analysis.
An RMSLE of 0.20025094970075333 is obtained with Principal Component Regression which is higher than RMSLE obtained with plain Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Random Forest and XG Boost.
Refer to these models on gmurage repositories on GitHub for comparison.
